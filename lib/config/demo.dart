The length of sandy beach here gets busy in the summer months, with families enjoying time off together.The city itself doesn’t have a wealth of character, and can be explored on an easy day trip from Casablanca. Walk around the 16th Century Portuguese Cistern and take in the sites from high up on its ramparts.',

        "Cancun’s a pretty well-known spot for spring breakers (and spring breakers at heart)—but its fun-loving spirit, miles of resorts, and nonstop nightlife is only one small part of the story. The city is one of Mexico’s all-around gems—literally made for vacationing. Its velvety beaches are some of the best the Caribbean has to offer, while scuba divers and snorkeling buffs will find plenty of action in the surf—including the Museo Subacuático de Arte, with its more than 500 underwater sculptures. On the outskirts of the city, sites like the pyramids of Chichen Itza give a deep-dive on the area’s sacred Maya heritage.",

        "The gateway to Africa – for Europeans, at least – has a strange and checkered past. The city’s famous International Zone was a magnet for all sorts of bizarre and curious characters, attracting many writers and artists during the 1950’s and 60’s – inspiring numerous novels and songs since.The Tangiers of today still holds on to its fanciful past, and outside influences have affected Tangiers’ aesthetic. But with new business booming and money flowing in, the city has seen much development and is now a fine display of Morocco’s future.",

After much of Agadir was destroyed following a devastating earthquake in 1960 – especially its most historical parts – the city was rebuilt, and is much less beautiful that Morocco’s many intricate old towns.But Agadir rose from the ashes and became a thriving seaside resort with a chilled out atmosphere to match. The city’s laid-back beachfront promenade is perfect for days spent strolling and enjoying life like the locals. Make sure to stop at one of the food stalls for a snack and chat with some of the city’s friendly inhabitants.",

Once under French protectorate, which led to a fusion of cultures and architectural styles, it saw hippies, musicians, and travelers of the 1960’s moving into the city. As a result, it became accustomed to foreigners, and is now a destination city for travelers wanting to spend some time wandering around the beautiful medina.",
